## About

Color match your view's background with your webview to avoid those scrolling color nightmares. I was tired of having some UIWebViews showing webpages and having to manually match colors for the sites to change background color resulting in a harsh color change when scrolling.

## Usage

Subclass the `JHWebPredatorViewController` class for showing webpages in your app.
