## About

Color match your view's background with your webview to avoid those scrolling color nightmares. I was tired of having UIWebViews showing webpages and having to manually match background colors, along with sites frequently changing background color resulting in a harsh color change when scrolling.

## Usage

Subclass the `JHWebPredatorViewController` class for showing webpages in your app.
